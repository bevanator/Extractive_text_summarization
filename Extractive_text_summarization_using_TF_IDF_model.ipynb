            " Despite a domestic agenda consumed by his response to last week’s terrorist attack in California, President Obama is closely tracking the United Nations climate change negotiations outside Paris, Secretary of State John Kerry said in an interview on Tuesday. Though the foundation of the Saudi economy could be threatened by an accord intended to turn the world away from fossil fuels like oil, Saudi Arabia is a desert nation that could also experience more devastating heat as a result of global warming. The United States and China have jointly pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but the United States has been pushing for aggressive terms requiring countries to verify their reduced emissions in a step that the Chinese see as intrusive. The president spoke by phone with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India on Tuesday about an agreement under consideration here and conferred by phone this week with President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, Mr. Kerry said. Some countries at the summit accuse the U.S. — which, in the 20th century, has emitted more carbon than any other — of trying to have it both ways: emitting more carbon per capita than almost any other country, while wagging fingers at the rest of the world.\n"
